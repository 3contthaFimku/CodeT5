# Pancharatra Agama Shastra: An Introduction
 
Pancharatra Agama Shastra is a branch of Hindu religious texts that belong to the Vaishnava tradition. The word Pancharatra means "five nights" and refers to the five nights of Brahma, the creator god, during which he revealed the secrets of creation and worship to his son Narayana, who later became Vishnu, the preserver god. The word Agama means "tradition" and refers to the precepts and doctrines that have come down as tradition[^2^].

The Pancharatra Agama Shastra consists of several texts called Samhitas, which are collections of verses, rituals, mantras, and theology. Some of the most important Samhitas are Ahirbudhniya, Aniruddha, Bharadvaja, Jayakhya, Lakshmi Tantra, Padma, Parama, Paushkara, Satvata, and Vishnu[^1^]. These texts describe various aspects of Vaishnava worship, such as the concept of Bhagavan (the supreme lord), the doctrine of Sankarshana (the cosmic soul), the theory of Vibhava (the incarnations of Vishnu), the practice of Archana (the ritual service of idols), and the philosophy of Achintya Bheda Abheda (the inconceivable difference and non-difference between God and souls).
 
The Pancharatra Agama Shastra is considered to be one of the sources of Vaishnava theology and practice. It is also regarded as a valid means of knowledge (Pramana) by some schools of Vedanta, such as Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita and Madhva's Dvaita. The Pancharatra Agama Shastra has influenced many aspects of Hindu culture, such as art, architecture, iconography, music, dance, literature, and ethics.

## History of Pancharatra Agama Shastra
 
The history of Pancharatra Agama Shastra is not very clear, as the texts are of different dates and origins. Some scholars suggest that the Pancharatra movement originated in late 3rd-century BCE, as a religious movement around the ideas of Narayana and the various avatars of Vishnu as their central deities[^2^]. The earliest use of the word Pancharatra is found in a Vedic text called Taittiriya Samhita, where it refers to a five-night ritual performed by a person to become a master of rhetorics. The same text also mentions Narayana as the primordial divinity who performed this offering[^1^]. The Narayaniya section of the Mahabharata, an epic composed between 4th-century BCE and 4th-century CE, refers to seven sages who say that the Pancharatra ritual was made consistent with the Vedas.
 
However, the earliest systematic exposition of the Pancharatra doctrine is found in a text called Shandilya Sutras, which is dated to around 100 CE. This text presents the devotional worship of Vishnu and his avatars as the supreme goal of life. It also describes the concept of Bhagavan (the supreme lord), who manifests himself in five forms: Para (the transcendent), Vyuha (the emanations), Vibhava (the incarnations), Antaryamin (the indweller), and Archa (the idol). It also prescribes various rituals, mantras, and meditations for attaining liberation through devotion. The Shandilya Sutras influenced many later texts of the Pancharatra tradition, such as Lakshmi Tantra, Padma Samhita, and Vishnu Samhita.
 
The Pancharatra texts were composed in Sanskrit and Tamil languages, and are classified into three categories: Samhitas (collections of verses), Tantras (treatises on rituals and practices), and Upa-Samhitas (supplementary texts). There are more than 200 texts in the Pancharatra corpus, but only a few of them are extant and available. Some of the most important texts are Ahirbudhniya Samhita, Aniruddha Samhita, Bharadvaja Samhita, Jayakhya Samhita, Lakshmi Tantra, Padma Samhita, Parama Samhita, Paushkara Samhita, Satvata Samhita, and Vishnu Samhita. These texts cover various topics such as cosmology, theology, philosophy, ethics, yoga, mantra, yantra, iconography, temple construction, idol worship, festivals, and social duties.
