# How to Identify a Mauser Rifle by Serial Number
 
Mauser rifles are famous for their bolt action system, which was developed by the German brothers Peter Paul and Wilhelm Mauser in the late 19th century. Mauser rifles were used by many countries in both world wars and are still popular among hunters and collectors today. But how can you tell if you have a genuine Mauser rifle or a copy? Here are some tips to help you identify a Mauser rifle by serial number.

## Check the Manufacturer's Name
 
The first thing to look for is the name of the manufacturer on the receiver or barrel of the rifle. The original Mauser factory was located in Oberndorf, Germany, and later became part of Deutsche Waffen-und Munitionsfabriken (DWM). Other German manufacturers that produced Mauser rifles include Ludwig Loewe & Co., Erfurt, Spandau, Amberg, Danzig, and Suhl. Some foreign manufacturers that licensed or copied the Mauser design include Fabrique Nationale (FN) in Belgium, Steyr in Austria, Oviedo in Spain, Ankara in Turkey, Brno in Czechoslovakia, and Zastava in Yugoslavia. If you see any of these names on your rifle, it is likely a Mauser or a variant.
 
## Check the Import Stamp
 
If your rifle was imported into the US after 1968, it should have an import stamp somewhere on the metal parts. The import stamp should indicate the name and address of the importer, the country of origin, and the caliber of the rifle. For example, an import stamp might read "CAI ST ALB VT / MAUSER 98 / 8MM / MADE IN YUGOSLAVIA". This means that the rifle was imported by Century Arms International from St. Albans, Vermont, and is a Yugoslavian-made Mauser 98 chambered in 8mm Mauser. The import stamp can help you narrow down the origin and model of your rifle.
 
## Check the Caliber
 
The caliber of your rifle can also help you identify its model and origin. The most common caliber for Mauser rifles is 7.92x57mm or 8mm Mauser, which was used by Germany and many other countries. However, there are also other calibers that were used by different nations or for different purposes. For example, Sweden adopted a Mauser carbine in 1894 and a Mauser rifle in 1896, both chambered in 6.5x55mm Swedish. Belgium adopted a Mauser rifle in 1889 chambered in 7.65x53mm Belgian. Turkey converted some of its older Mausers to 7.62x51mm NATO in the 1950s. Some civilian models of Mauser rifles were chambered in popular hunting calibers such as .30-06 Springfield or .375 H&H Magnum. You can usually find the caliber marked on the barrel or receiver of your rifle.
 
## Check the Serial Number
 
The serial number of your rifle can provide some clues about its model and date of manufacture. However, you should be aware that serial numbers were not always consistent or unique among different manufacturers or countries. Some serial numbers were repeated or restarted after a certain point. Some serial numbers were mixed or matched with parts from different rifles. Some serial numbers were altered or removed by previous owners or collectors. Therefore, you should not rely solely on the serial number to identify your rifle.
 
That being said, here are some general guidelines for interpreting serial numbers on Mauser rifles:
 
- The serial number is usually located on the left side of the receiver, but sometimes also on the barrel, bolt, floorplate, or stock.
- The serial number usually consists of four or five digits followed by one or two letters. For example, "1234 AB" or "56789 C".
- The letters indicate the production series or block within a given year or model. For example, "A" is the first series, "B" is the second series, and so on.
- The first digit of the serial number usually indicates the year of manufacture within a given decade. For example, "1" means 1901, 1911, 1921, etc., "2" means 1902, 1912, 1922, 0f148eb4a0
